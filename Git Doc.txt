Basic commands

- There is staging area before commiting file.
    -To add a file in staging area
        git add <fileName>
            // Now file is successfully added to staging area.

    -To add multiple files into staging area
        git add .
            //This will add all files into sta

    -To check the status
        git status
            // This will show status like changes to be commited and now we can commit

    -To restore or untrack or unstage file
        git restore --staged <fileName>
            // Now any file which is added to staging area will be undo and goes back to untrack stage

    -To save file 
        git commit  
        or
        git commit -m "commit message"
            // commit message indicates what changes you have made in this commit
            // very first commit is called as initial commit
            // Save the changes

    -To Commit without adding to staging area
        git commit -am "commit message"
            //This will directly commit without adding to staging area

    - To check log
        git log
            //shows where the head is and all commits




Branching commands:
-We can create multiple branches here and later on we merge them into master branch

    - To make new branch
        git branch <branchName>
            // This will create new branch having copy of master branch
            // contain same contents present master branch

    
    - To transfer control to other branch
        git checkout <branchName>
            // Now your control moved to specific(given) branch 

Merging commands
- suppose you have made changes in new branch say 'v1' now you want to merge those changes
  to master branch we use merge 

    - For that first switch to master branch and 
        git merge <branchName>
            //now you are in master branch and adding changes of v1 branch to master branch
            //when this command gets hit it merge v1 branch to master branch
            //now changes of v1 branch also attached to master branch     


Remote Operations :
-Used To push or pull over github

    -To set Remote Location
        git remote add <OriginName> <GitURL>
        eg. git remote add origin https://github.com/mahajansomesh4/GitDemo.git
            // This command set a remote server from where we push or pull files
            // The OriginName can be anything you want

    -To check your Remote server
        git remote -v
        // This command returns the GitURL of push and pull request
        // Means that from where we make pull and pull request

    -To push on github 
        git push -u <OriginName> <branchName>
        eg. git push -u origin master
